## TIPS
```
express@4.17.1
50 other packages installed 

4 = major update
17 = minor update
- with express (which we downloaded) 50 other packages were downloaded that express uses as well
- within the node module folder, you can click into express and you can see that express has its own package.json as well as its own dependencies
- node is all about a package ecosystem
```
